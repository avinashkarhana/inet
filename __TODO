Routing table handling questions:
 - what should happen when an interface goes down or carrier is lost?
   - with interface routes?
   - with static routes added by network configurator?
   - with routes added by routing protocols?
 - what should happen when an interface comes back up or carrier is back?
 - what happens when a route added by a routing protocol is expired?

General routing table considerations:
 - the module that adds a route is responsible for removing it and re-adding it
 - routing table doesn't check if a route is active, valid, expired, enabled, interface is up, interface has carrier, etc. it checks NOTHING
   - if a route is present in the routing table it is used, period
   - routes are added/removed to/from the routing table by external modules
     - network configurator
     - routing protocol
     - manual routing configuration
 - routing table doesn't add/remove routes on its own EVER
 - network interface adds/removes network interface routes ONLY, other routes are not affected
   - when the interface is up and has carrier the network interface route is added, otherwise it is removed
 - network configurator adds/removes routes for shortest path or manual routes
   - it can act on interface up/down and carrier up/down
 - routing file configuration module
   - adds routes to routing table during initialize
   - removes routes if the interface goes down or carrier is lost
   - re-adds routes if the interface comes back up or carrier is back
